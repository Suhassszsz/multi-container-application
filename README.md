 🐳 Multi-Container Docker Application

This project demonstrates a multi-container Docker architecture consisting of a frontend, backend, and Nginx reverse proxy. It uses Docker Compose to orchestrate these services seamlessly.

 ⚙️ Components Overview

 🔹 Frontend

- Responsible for the user interface of the application.
  
- Communicates with the backend through defined API routes.
  
- Runs in a separate container, isolated from the backend and proxy layers.
  
- Built using a modern frontend framework such as React or Vue.js.

🔹 Backend

- Handles API requests, application logic, and database operations.
  
- Exposes RESTful endpoints used by the frontend.
  
- Built using Python Flask or Node.js Express.
  
- Runs in a separate container, with internal access controlled by Docker networking.

 🔹 Nginx

- Serves as a reverse proxy.
  
- Routes incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate frontend or backend services.
  
- Provides centralized traffic management and can be extended for load balancing or SSL termination.
  
- Configured using the `nginx.conf` file.

 🔹 Docker Compose

- Manages all the services through a single configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`).
  
- Defines how containers are built, connected, and exposed.
  
- Ensures services run in isolated yet communicative environments through shared networks.

🚀 Usage Instructions

Step 1: Clone the Repository

- Download the project to your local system.

Step 2: Build and Start Containers

- Use Docker Compose to build and spin up all containers simultaneously. This ensures all components (frontend, backend, and Nginx) are up and connected.

 Step 3: Access the Application

- Visit the application in your browser via `http://localhost`.

- The frontend will be visible by default, and it internally connects to the backend via Nginx.

🧼 Cleanup Instructions

- To stop all running containers and remove them along with their associated volumes and networks, use Docker Compose down commands.
